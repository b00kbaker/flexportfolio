           Hi, my name is Caitlin Murphy and I am new to the coding world. From a young age I 
         knew that a typical 9-5 job in the same town I grew up in was not for me, I wanted adventure
         and with time I learned I needed joy and passion in my work life. While I have had plenty of adventures
         living in various places (Italy, Australia, & the Rocky Mountain states of the USA) I am challenging myself
         with learning web developtment to start a new and fulfilling chapter in my professional life.

             My previous career was as a pastry cook at fine dining establishments creating dishes that were both
            pleasing to the eyes and taste buds. I loved every aspect of the culinary lifestyle; the creative aspect, 
            the logic of planning and preparation, the adrenaline of service, and the countless job oportunities that make
            moving to incredible new places easy. While I had my eyes on moving up the ladder to a Michelin Star restaurant 
            life had other plans, 7 years into this passion I developed a severe gluten allergy and had to leave the business.
